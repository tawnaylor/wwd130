      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn. You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Love Ya Like A Sister, sans-serif
      </h4>
      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Noto Serif, serif
      </h4>
      <h3>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h3>
      <p>
        I have chosen two fonts that I feel would work very well with this theme of a website. The heading font is a fun and playful font that I feel would work well with the theme of a D&D campaign. The paragraph font is a serif font that I feel would be easy to read and would work well with the heading font.

      <h2>Characters Profiles</h2>

        Character development is central to the Dungeons & Dragons experience, and the website will offer a comprehensive space for players to showcase and deepen their connections to their characters.
