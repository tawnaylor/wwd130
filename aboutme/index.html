<h2>Taw Naylor</h2>
<p>Hi everyone, my name is Taw Naylor and am excited to be in this class.</p>
<p>I am working on Web Front End and Web Back End certificates at the moment and I want to be about to do Full Stack in the future. 
I currently work as a graphic designer for a company in Salt Lake City and that is were I found my passion for web design.</p>
<p>I love mountain biking and just being outdoors. I find that I have way to many hobbies and I think it would be nice to just focus of a few and really get good at them.</p>
<p>I work for OCTanner in Salt Lake making design collection yearbooks, rings, and emblems for companies all over the world.</p>
<p>BYU-Idaho has been a wonderful expierenece for me because I feel like it has been a great learning for me. 
I first went for my certificate in social media marketing, then in graphic design, now I'm working towards to more certificates in web development.</p>
<p>I have been able to sit really close with people who do our companies web design and I watch how they work and the cool things that come from it. 
I have spent time sitiing with them and watching the work they do and I foud that I was very intersted in the work.</p> 
<p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for 38 years now. I </p>
<p>I would say that my favorite scripture is ENOS: 1 4-8</p>
<p> 4 And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.
    5 And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.
    6 And I, Enos, knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt was swept away.
    7 And I said: Lord, how is it done?
    8 And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor seen. And many years pass away before he shall manifest himself in the flesh; wherefore, go to, thy faith hath made thee whole.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to learning tons from this class.</p>
